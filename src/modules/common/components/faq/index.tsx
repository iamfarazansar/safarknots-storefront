    question: "How long does it take to make a custom rug?",
    answer:
      "The timeline for a custom rug typically ranges from 2 to 4 weeks depending on the complexity of the design, size, and current order volume. We'll provide a more accurate estimate when you receive your free quotation.",
  },
  {
    question: "What materials do you use?",
    answer:
      "We primarily use 100% premium New Zealand wool for its superior softness, durability, and vibrant color retention. We also offer acrylic yarn options for those looking for a different texture or a more budget-friendly alternative.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you ship internationally?",
    answer:
      "Yes! We ship our custom rugs worldwide. Shipping costs and delivery times vary depending on your location, which will be detailed in your final invoice.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I care for and clean my rug?",
    answer:
      "For regular maintenance, vacuum your rug gently using a suction-only setting (avoid beater bars). For spills, blot immediately with a clean, dry cloth — do not rub. For deep cleaning, we recommend professional rug cleaning services.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you turn any picture into a rug?",
    answer:
      "We can turn almost any clear image, logo, or concept into a rug! Highly detailed or photorealistic images may need to be slightly simplified into a stylized design. We always share a mockup for your approval before production begins.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you accept returns on custom orders?",
    answer:
      "Because custom rugs are made uniquely for you, we cannot accept returns or exchanges. However, we ensure you are involved in the design process and approve the artwork before we start, ensuring you get exactly what you envisioned.",
